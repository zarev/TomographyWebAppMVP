The most basic version (MVP) of your tomographic reconstruction web app should focus on core functionality that delivers value quickly and is easy to build. Here’s a streamlined version of your vision:

MVP Features

Frontend (UI)

	1.	Data Upload:
	•	Drag-and-drop area for uploading datasets (HDF5, TIFF).
	•	Display basic file metadata after upload (e.g., number of slices, resolution).
	2.	Pipeline Builder:
	•	Predefined tiles for essential steps:
	•	Normalization
	•	Ring Artifact Removal
	•	Center of Rotation Estimation
	•	Reconstruction
	•	Simple linear flow (no drag-and-drop for this phase; steps execute sequentially).
	3.	Visualization:
	•	Basic image viewer for:
	•	Sinogram slices
	•	Reconstructed slices
	•	Scrollable slider for navigating through slices.
	4.	Result Export:
	•	Option to download results (normalized sinograms, reconstructions) as TIFF files.

Backend (Python)

	1.	Framework:
	•	Use FastAPI for the API backend.
	2.	Core APIs:
	•	/upload: Handles dataset uploads, validates file types, and saves files.
	•	/process: Executes a sequential workflow with steps for:
	•	Normalization
	•	Ring removal
	•	CoR estimation
	•	Reconstruction
	•	/results: Endpoint to retrieve processed results.
	3.	Key Processing Steps:
	•	Normalization: Compute normalized projections using flat and dark fields.
	•	Ring Artifact Removal: Apply simple ring-removal filters (e.g., from sarepy or median filtering).
	•	CoR Estimation: Use tomopy.find_center to estimate the center of rotation.
	•	Reconstruction: Perform FBP using ASTRA or TomoPy.
	4.	Result Handling:
	•	Store intermediate and final results temporarily on the server.
	•	Provide links for users to download results.

Tech Stack

	•	Frontend:
	•	Framework: HTML/CSS with JavaScript or a lightweight library like Vue.js for dynamic elements.
	•	Styling: TailwindCSS for quick and clean dark mode design.
	•	Backend:
	•	Framework: FastAPI for its simplicity and built-in async features.
	•	Processing: Python libraries (TomoPy, ASTRA, NumPy).
	•	Deployment:
	•	Use Docker Compose for containerization.
	•	Host on a lightweight server like AWS EC2 or DigitalOcean.

User Workflow

	1.	Upload Data:
	•	Drag and drop your dataset.
	•	File metadata is displayed (e.g., slice count, dimensions).
	2.	Set Parameters:
	•	Basic input fields for each step (e.g., ring removal strength, CoR search range).
	3.	Run Workflow:
	•	Click a “Run” button to process the data sequentially.
	•	Display progress for each step.
	4.	View Results:
	•	Basic viewer for reconstructed slices.
	•	Option to download results as TIFF files.

Development Phases

Phase 1: Backend

	•	Implement core APIs (/upload, /process, /results).
	•	Add processing logic for normalization, CoR estimation, and reconstruction.

Phase 2: Frontend

	•	Build a simple UI with:
	•	Drag-and-drop upload.
	•	Progress bar for workflow execution.
	•	Basic image viewer for results.

Phase 3: Deployment

	•	Deploy on a cloud platform using Docker.
	•	Ensure the app can handle medium-sized datasets.

Basic UI Design

Home Page:

	•	Large upload area with a dark theme.
	•	A “Run Workflow” button becomes active after upload.

Processing Page:

	•	Tiles for each step with parameters below:
	•	Step 1: Normalization
	•	Step 2: Ring Removal
	•	Step 3: CoR Estimation
	•	Step 4: Reconstruction
	•	Progress bar or status indicator for each step.

Result Viewer:

	•	Single image viewer with navigation for slices.
	•	Download button for results.

Would you like me to mock up UI wireframes or provide sample Python code for one of the backend functionalities?
